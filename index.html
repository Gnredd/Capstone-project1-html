            <h2>Summary</h1>
            <p>After working for 7 plus years in DevOps and other projects, I have decided it's time to take new route. Full stack has always been my passion back of my head but never pursued serioulsy. I said enough is enough, decided to put in work and here I am. Objective is to become Full stack Web2 +Web3 Developer which is nothing but Full-Stack Blockchain Engineer.</p>
